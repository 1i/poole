- JS dev to a Java dev
- Married 5 years
- Dad to a 2 year old
- Remote working for 6+ months due to COVID19


I still enjoy playing around with tech outside of my field of work.
Tech that solves issues for end users, I guess that comes from my wanting to fix peoples IT problems.
- Alexa apps
- The amazing work of Cornell university https://birdnet.cornell.edu/live/
- Free as much
